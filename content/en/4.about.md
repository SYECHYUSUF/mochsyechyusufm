description: Hi! I’m Moch Syech Yusuf M, but most people call me Ucup. I’m an
  Information Systems student at Universitas Hasanuddin with a strong passion
  for becoming a Software Engineer. I enjoy blending design, code, and
  creativity to build meaningful web experiences.  Outside of class, I love
  designing websites, editing videos, volunteering at community events, and
  reading books to expand my knowledge. I’m also passionate about building
  connections and learning more about business development. Always curious,
  always growing—I’m constantly working on personal projects and seeking new
  opportunities to improve myself.

Even when I'm not working for my clients, I'm always looking for new things to learn and experiment with. I continue to develop my design and development skills by working on personal projects, reading books, etc...
